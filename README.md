FEATURES
--------
 * 21 levels (0-20). You can choose which level to start between
   (only start on level 0-9 though).

 * 16 different level patterns!

 * Hiscore table with names! The three best results are saved.

 * Teacher key! If you see your techer heading your way, quickly
   press the teacher key to return to TI-OS, and when you start
   the game the next time, you'll automatically resume where you
   was. If you run it from a shell however, it returns to the
   shell instead. But that's your problem, not mine :)

 * Linkplay! Play against each other and kick some butt! The link
   protocol is the same as in ZTetris for the 86 and Tetris for Fargo,
   so you could link an 82 to an 85, 86, or a 92 and play against each other!

 * The scoring is almost the same from the Game Boy version. The last digit
   in the score isn't shown (you could think of it that way anyway) because
   of several reasons. Unlike the ZShell version, you also score for
   dropping or moving down a piece.

 * You can start with trashlines. It's different from the gameboy version
   though, because there is no win-when-cleared-25-lines.

 * In linkplay, you can choose if you want to get scrambled (as in Tetris
   for Windows) or unscrambled (Tetris for Gameboy) lines.

 * Rotation in both direction. You can pause the game (1 player)

SCORING
-------
|          | L 0  | L 1 | L 2 | L 3 | L 4 | L 5 | L 6 | L 7 | L 8  | L 9  |
| -------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 line   |    4 |   8 |  12 |  16 |  20 |  24 |  28 |  32 |   36 |   40 |
| 2 lines  |   10 |  20 |  30 |  40 |  50 |  60 |  70 |  80 |   90 |  100 |
| 3 lines  |   30 |  60 |  90 | 120 | 150 | 180 | 210 | 240 |  270 |  300 |
| 4 lines  |  120 | 240 | 360 | 480 | 600 | 720 | 840 | 960 | 1080 | 1200 |

When dropping a piece, your score will increase with dropsteps/10 (the
last digit will remain in memory, although not shown). Every time you
move the piece down (with the down key) you will increase the score with
0.1.

LINKPLAY
--------
To play linkplay, first connect two TI-83's (or connect the TI-83 to a
TI-82, TI-85, TI-86, or a TI-92) and choose two player mode. The level selection
menu looks slightly different. Besides from choosing which level to start at
(the two players can start at different levels), you can choose how many
penalty lines should be sent to the other calc when clearing lines. Either
you send 2-4 lines (if you get 2-4 lines) or 1-3, ie one line less than you
cleared. This option can also be different on both calcs, thus allowing
handicap. You can also toggle if you want to get unscrambled penalty lines
or scrambled penalty lines. If choosing unscramble (defualt), the lines sent
to you will only have one gap, making it much easier than getting totally
scrambled lines.

Press Enter to start the game. Now the calc will go into waiting mode and
wait until the other player has reached this mode. When one player enters
the waiting mode, the other player MUST have started ZTetris (or be in an
assembly shell) because else the game would start immediately for the first
player. If you link with a TI-82 or a TI-85 or a TI-86 or a TI-92, the other calc must enter Waiting mode first.

Now the fun begins!

You play as you usually do, but when you clear 2 or more lines, the other
opponent will get penalty lines depening on how many lines you cleared and
the option choosed when selecting startlevel.

There is also a bar telling how high up in the playing field your opponent
is (it's not visible in the beginning since the field is empty). This is
good when choosing strategy.

When a player loses, or aborts the game, a "You won" message will appear
on the other calc.

You can't pause or use the teacher key in two player mode, and you can
neither enter the hiscore table (even though score is counted)

When you play against an 85/86 know that the 82 version runs slightly
faster than those versions. Set the 85/86, one level higher than the 82
to even things out.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
 * Don't pull out the linkcable while playing twoplayer! The calcs
   may freeze a few seconds (not crash).
 * The linkplay probably isn't that stable, and the calc may freeze
   sometimes for a short time. It is also possible that one player
   may "miss" some penalty lines :) See this as a feature instead hehe :)
